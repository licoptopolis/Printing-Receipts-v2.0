# Printing-Receipts-v2.0
The purpose of the code is to create a formatted receipt for a shopping transaction at Tesco PLC.

Use cases of the code:

Generating a receipt for a customer after a shopping transaction at Tesco.
Providing a summary of the purchased products, their prices, and the total amount.
Displaying information about Tesco's fuel savings program.
Displaying a thank you message at the end of the receipt.

Possible improvements for the future:

Abstracting the formatting logic into functions or classes for better maintainability and reusability.
Using a template engine or formatting library to create more dynamic and customisable receipts.
Storing the company name, address, and county information in a configuration file or a database for easier updates.
Using a more secure and unique method to generate the Clubcard number, instead of random choices from '0123456789'.
Providing options for localisation and currency conversion for international customers.
Adding error handling and validation for the input data and formatting to ensure reliability and accuracy of the receipt.
Using proper commenting and documentation to improve code readability and understanding.
